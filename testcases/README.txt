INFORMATION:

- The result files expected are in the "Expected Results" directory.

- All results except those in StateResult_FS.txt and StateResult_SS.txt files should match the 
  expected result files for each test case.
  
- The StateResult_FS.txt and StateResult_SS.txt should print out all the fields in the internal
  state registers as per your design. This will be used to verify the behaviour of your design.
  
- Five test cases have been revealed and there are 5 more against which your design will be
  evaluated as previously mentioned.
